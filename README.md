How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs involves analyzing requirements and translating them into practical development tasks. User stories, concise narratives that depict specific user interactions, assist in this process by providing a user-centered perspective, making it easier to approach the implementation of features within a program in a focused and understandable manner.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my approach to program development, I give precedence to an agile methodology, placing emphasis on iterative progress and collaborative efforts. I intend to integrate Scrum processes, including sprint planning and regular retrospectives, to boost communication, adaptability, and the overall effectiveness of my future development projects.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a strong team member in software development means actively contributing to collaborative efforts, maintaining open lines of communication, and prioritizing the team's overall success. It requires not only participating in discussions and sharing perspectives but also demonstrating adaptability, embracing feedback, and taking responsibility for individual tasks to foster a positive team dynamic. Effectively blending these elements contributes to a cooperative team culture and ensures the successful delivery of top-notch software solutions.
